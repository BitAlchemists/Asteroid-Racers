== v0.4 - 2014-05-31 ==
This release adds a lot of depth to the game. 

There is now a checkpoint system that adds the possibility to fly routes thru the asteroid belt. If you crash into an asteroid, you will respawn at the last reached checkpoint. The ship is now smoother to navigate with doe to better input handling.

There is also a richer background with two parallax layers, the sun, the earth and a nearby satellite. Asteroids got a little makeover. The game now shines in fullscreen mode and provides native UI controls.

+ added sun to star background
+ add second parallax layer
  + added earth
  + added satellite
+ custom UI elements
+ better spaceship control
+ particle effect for spaceship
+ fullscreen
+ checkpoint system
  + order in which they have to be touched
  + respawn on checkpoints

+ add collision detection
  + debug field to show collision areas
  + explosion animation
  + players respawn after a collision
+ add fps counter
+ add star background with parallax effect

== v0.2 - 2014-05-23 ==
This version provides a more polished version of 0.1 and mainly focused on infrastructure.

Changelog:

~ only notify the server of position updates when they actually happen
  This reduces a bit of server load, but not much. Since when the player starts moving, these are happening all of the time.
~ make chat work again
~ make console logging on client work

Known Issues: 
- The coordinate system shown ist that of typical 2D graphics libraries with the positive y-axis extending downwards. I want it the other way.


= Milestone 1 =
== v0.1 - 2014-05-22 ==
This version allows you to run a server, where multiple players can connect to and see each other move around.

+ Multiple Players connecting to the same server
+ moving around
+ seeing each other move around

Known Issues:
- Players are sometimes beeing cloned
