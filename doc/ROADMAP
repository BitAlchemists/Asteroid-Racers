== v0.2 - 2014-05-23 ==
This version provides a more polished version of 0.1 and mainly focused on infrastructure.

Changelog:

~ only notify the server of position updates when they actually happen
  This reduces a bit of server load, but not much. Since when the player starts moving, these are happening all of the time.
~ make chat work again
~ make console logging on client work

Known Issues: 
- The coordinate system shown ist that of typical 2D graphics libraries with the positive y-axis extending downwards. I want it the other way.

+ Multiple Players connecting to the same server
