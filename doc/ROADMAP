== v0.2 ==
This version provides a more polished version of 0.1 and mainly focused on infrastructure.

Changelog:
+ players may select a username before connecting
  + player names are shown next to the model
  + give a random username if the user does not provide one
+ show own coordinates to allow coordination of players

+ disconnecting/reconnecting now supported
  + connect/disconnect buttons
+ remove disconnected players
+ colorful asteroids
~ only notify the server of position updates when they actually happen
  This reduces a bit of server load, but not much. Since when the player starts moving, these are happening all of the time.
~ make chat work again
~ make console logging on client work

Known Issues: 
- The coordinate system shown ist that of typical 2D graphics libraries with the positive y-axis extending downwards. I want it the other way.


= Milestone 1 =
